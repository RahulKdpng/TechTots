student--> Hey man, I came across a weird index number today.
teacher--> Okay, I'm a bit confused here. 
teacher--> How can a number be weird?
student--> Cuz it's got a colon in it. See.
student--> word= 'helipad'
student--> print(word[2:6])
teacher--> Oh, that! Well, you see, it's not exactly an index number
student--> Whatt
student--> But it's written just like it, 
student--> inside square brackets beside the string's name.
teacher--> Yeah. But there are two numbers here, 2 and 6 , with a colon.
student--> So what does that mean?
teacher--> Well, what'll happen if we do this?
teacher--> word= "helipad"
teacher--> word[3]
student--> We get the fourth character in the string.
teacher--> word ="helinad"
teacher--> print(word[3])
teacher--> output: i
teacher--> Meaning, if we give one index number, we get one letter.
student--> Mm-hmm
teacher--> But when we write word [2:6], we give Python more than one index number.
student--> So lemme guess, [2:6] gives us all the letters at these indexes in 'helipad'
teacher--> Voila! We'll get the letters from index 2 to 5.
student--> You mean 6, right?
teacher--> No, I mean 5.
teacher--> Well, that's how it is. Python ignores the letter at 
teacher--> the ending number, ie the one at index 6 here
student--> Cool. So basically, with [2:6], I get a part of the string.
teacher--> Exactly!
student--> word = 'helipad'
student--> print(word[2:6])
student--> output: lipa
teacher--> We call this part a substring and the feature of 
teacher--> gettin' small parts of a string as slicing.
student--> That's okay. But dude, how do I get the last Letter?
teacher--> Well, Python has got two ways of doin' that. One is, 
teacher--> you don't write anything after the colon.
student--> Oh, you mean no ending number? Yeah, that's a great solution!!!!
teacher--> No man, seriously. Here, take a look.
teacher--> word = 'helipad'
teacher--> print(word[2:])
teacher--> output: lipad
student--> Damn, it actually worked!!
teacher--> Yeah, and that's cuz Python automatically takes the 
teacher--> index of the last letter as the endpoint here.
student--> So if I'm right, not givin' a starting number, means 
student--> Python will take the index of the first character in the string
teacher--> Exactly!
teacher--> word = 'helipad'
teacher--> print(word[:6])
teacher--> output: helipa
student--> I knew it! But, you said there is another way of displaying the last letter.
teacher--> Yeah, you set the length of the string as the endpoint.
student--> You mean the number of letters in the string?
teacher--> Yup!!!!!
student--> Well, I'm not interested in countin characters
teacher--> Then it's a good thing Python has len().
student--> And what the heck is that?!
teacher--> O it tells the number of characters in a string. So look and be amazed, buddy.
teacher--> word = 'helipad'
teacher--> print(len(word))
teacher--> output: 7
teacher--> You just gotta write the variable name 
teacher--> that holds the string inside the brackets of len().
student--> Crazy! So lemme use the length and try this
student--> word ="helipad"
student--> length = len(word) 
student--> print(word [2:length])
student--> output: lipad
student--> Here, length holds the number of letters in 
student--> 'helipad. So, word [2:length] becomes 
student--> word [2:7]
student--> And we got the letters from the index 2 to 6 
student--> i.e. 7-1!!
teacher--> Which includes the last letter in 'helipad'.
teacher--> Now, I've one last thing for you..
student--> Well, it's one hell of a goodbye gift
student--> So what does this do?
teacher--> Let's start with print(word[:]). Wanna guess 
teacher--> what it'll display?
student--> Hmm. No starting and ending number, huh. 
student--> So word[:] should become word [0:Len(word)]
student--> Meaning, we'll get the entire string.
teacher--> You're right!
teacher--> word= 'helipad'
teacher--> print(word[:])
teacher--> output: helipad
teacher--> And now to print(word[:]).
teacher--> Next, it hops over i and displays p, somethin' like this.
student--> So basically, it skips the letter after the one it displays!
teacher--> Mm-hm. And it skips one letter every time 
teacher--> because of the number 2.
teacher--> word = 'helipad'
teacher--> print(word[::2])
teacher--> output: hlpd
student--> Wait, so if I write in 'helipad?
teacher--> Mm-hmm. Then it displays i and skips two 
teacher--> letters again.
student--> Thanks, for makin' it all crystal clear!
teacher--> QUIZ TIME!!!!!!!!
student--> John challenges Lola with the word waterfall. 
student--> Fill in the blanks to get the Length of the hidden words 
student--> and add 'em to calculate the points.
student--> word = "waterfall"
student--> word_1 = word[:5]
student--> word_2 = word[5:]
student--> points =_______(word_1)+_______(_______)
student--> options: Length,len,Len,word_2,length
teacher--> answer: len,len,word_2
teacher--> We use len to find a string's length in Python and 
teacher--> write the variable name that holds the string in between
teacher--> brackets after len
student--> It's Lola's turn, and she gives the word therapy to John.
student--> John finds the hidden word which is her. 
student--> Fill in the gaps to slice the word out!
student--> word = "therapy"
student--> word_1 = word[_______:_______]
student--> points = len(word_1)
teacher--> answer is 1:4
teacher--> The starting index of her is 1 as letter h is at index 1 in string therapy.
teacher--> And the ending index will be 4 as the index of letter r is 3.
