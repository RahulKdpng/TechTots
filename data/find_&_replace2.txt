student--> Hey, did I ever tell you I like writing?
teacher--> No. No, you did not
student--> Well, here is the thing. I love writing!
student--> And lately, I've been working on an essay.
teacher--> Good for ya, man! But, any reason why 
teacher--> you decided to declare your love all of a sudden?
student--> Well, you see, halfway through the essay 
student--> I realized I've used 'recieve' instead of 'receive'.
teacher--> Ugh, that word!
teacher--> I can't imagine the number of times 
teacher--> I've gotten it wrong.
student--> O I hear ya, buddy. So, is there anything I can 
student--> do about it?
teacher--> Yeah, go through your essay and change its spelling.
student--> Like I didn't think of that.
teacher--> Oh, you mean an easier solution?
student--> Obviously! Like somethin' in Python that could help.
teacher--> Know what, you're right! We can use Python here.
student--> And that's why I freakin' love Python!
teacher--> So, Python has a feature called replace().
teacher--> Using it, you can change one word to another 
teacher--> in any string.
student--> Awesome, man!
teacher--> And here is how we use it.
teacher--> line= "O'really? bababa!" 
teacher--> print(line.replace('ba', 'ha'))
teacher--> coding: O'really? hahaha!
student--> Ah, Python replaced all 'ba' with 'ha'! Perfect!
teacher--> Yeah. But remember, the first word in the 
teacher--> bracket is the one you wanna replace in the string.
student--> Right, and that's 'ba' here! While the second 
student--> word in the bracket, 'ha', replaces the first one.
teacher--> Yep!
student--> So hey, I had a li'l doubt. What if I wanna 
student--> replace just the first 2 'ba' and not all of 'em?
student--> Is there a way in Python, hm?
teacher--> Ah, there is always a way in Python. 
teacher--> Remember, I said this before.
student--> Yeah, yeah, smarty pants!
teacher--> Well, to replace just 2 'ba', we'll have to give 
teacher--> the count of replacements like this.
teacher--> line= "O'really? bababa!"
teacher--> print(line.replace('ba', 'ha', 2))
teacher--> coding: O'really? hahaba!
student--> Hmm~
student--> So here, Python changed the first two 'ba' to 
student--> 'ha' cuz of the number 2 in the second line.
teacher--> Exactly!
teacher--> And if I wrote 1. Python would replace just 
teacher--> the first 'ba' in the line.
student--> Yeah, I thought so!
student--> line = "O'really? bababa!"
student--> print(line.replace('ba', 'ha', 1))
student--> output: O'really? hababa!
teacher--> Great! So, wanna know another cool feature?
student--> Sure do.
teacher--> line = 'I saw Dave on his bicycle.' 
teacher--> print(line.replace('Dave', 'Donna'). replace('his', 'her'))
teacher--> output: 'I saw Donna on her bicycle.'
student--> I see. It replaced both 'Dave' and 'his' in one go.
teacher--> Yeah, Python executes the two replace()
teacher--> instructions one after the other.
teacher--> So first, it replaces 'Dave' by 'Donna', 
teacher--> changin' the line to - I saw Donna on his bicycle.
student--> Right! Then in this new line, it changes 'his' to 'her'.
teacher--> Bingo!
student--> Cool! And now, I'm gonna go and fix my essay!
teacher--> Yeah, run off to your beloved! And stay true to her, okay?
student--> Will do!!
teacher--> QUIZ TIME NOW!!!!!
student--> Fill in the blanks so that star is replaced with car.
student--> poem = "twinkle, twinkle, little star
student--> how I wonder what you are""
student--> print(______.______(______,______))
student--> options:  'star' ,poem  , 'car', replace
teacher--> Correct Answer is poem , replace , 'star' , 'car'
teacher--> To replace 'star', we start with the variable. 
teacher--> Then we put a dot. Next comes the word replace. 
teacher--> And inside the brackets, we first write 'star', 
teacher--> then comes the word that will replace it, 'car'.
student--> Fill in the blanks so that 'world' is replaced to 'hill' and 'diamond' to 'butterfly'.
student--> verse = "up above the world so high 
student--> like a diamond in the sky"
student--> print(verse.______('world',______).______('diamond'.______))
student--> options are replace, 'butterfly' , 'hill' .
teacher--> Correct Answer is replace, 'hill' , 'butterfly'
teacher--> We can use multiple replace methods in one line. 
teacher--> So, in verse.replace('world','hill').replace('diamond', 'butterfly'), 
teacher--> the first replace will change 'world' to 'hill'. 
teacher--> And the second one will change 'diamond' to 'butterfly'.
