student--> YOOO!!!
teacher--> Super dude!! How did your hacking prank go??
student--> Awesome!!man some of my friends totally freaked out.
teacher--> Great!!
student--> Yeah!! so, I remember you were telling me there are two types of loops.
teacher--> Hmmm-mm one is the While loop and other is For loop 
student--> Okayyyy
teacher--> So, let me show a for loop example.
teacher--> for num in range (0,10):
teacher--> .    print(num)
student--> Dude, the line 1 , is it something written in Latin??!!
teacher--> No No, it is still a python instruction.
teacher--> It tells python to repeat line 2 for numbers 0 to 9.
student--> But How??
teacher--> Okay, so basically Python runs the loop for each number in the range 0 to 10.
teacher--> And here, num in line 1 is a variable.
student--> Ohh!! So in a for loop. we create a variable just after the word for?
teacher--> Exactly! and the loop starts with 0 Meaning num holds the value 0 in the first loop.
teacher--> for num in range(0,5): #In loop1 num=0,
teacher--> .     print(num)
student--> yeah and next Python moves to line 2 and displays the value in num, i.e. 0.
teacher--> Then it goes to line 1 again and startes the second loop.
teacher--> But this time, num holds the second number in the range 0 to 5.
student--> and that is 1!
student--> for num in range (0,5): #in loop 2 , num=1.
student--> .    print(num)
teacher--> Right! and this way, python continues to loop until the number 4.
student--> wait!! should not it be 5? means it is range 0 to 5, right?
teacher--> ummmm!!! no cuz range 0 to 5 means it starts from 0 and ends at the number just before 5 i.e., 4.
student--> so, number in the range are 0,1,2,3 and 4!!
teacher--> yup!! and those are the numbers python displays here.
teacher--> for num in range (0,5):
teacher--> .     print(num)
teacher--> output: 0
teacher--> 1
teacher--> 2
teacher--> 3
teacher--> 4
student--> Hey, the for loop is pretty simple!!
teacher--> yeah!! and we can make it even simpler like this.
teacher--> for num in range(5):
teacher--> print(num)
student--> ahh!! so you changed range (0,5) to range(5) here, but, that does not make any sense!!
student--> The range should have a starting and an ending point.
teacher--> you are right!! It should have a starting point. That is why for range(5), python assumes 0 as the starting point.
student--> Got it!!
teacher--> Now, tell me what exactly is happening when we print numbers in the range 0 to 5.
student--> ummm... we are printing 0 to 4. what is this question??
teacher--> I will explain, so we are starting from 0 incrementing the value by 1 which becomes 0+1=1 and so on.
student--> woooww, did not think in this way..
teacher--> Not your fault, that little brain, could not think much.
student--> HAHAHAHA!!! very funny.
teacher--> Coming to the point now. I mentioned this because the range function has 3 parameters. start,end,step.
student--> But we have only seen start and end.
student--> for num in range(0,5):
student--> Here starts=0 and end=5
teacher--> Yes, but here the step by default is 1.
teacher--> That means we are incrementing the variable num by 1 starting from the start and ending at the end parameters.
teacher--> If we want to increment the variable with any other number apart from 1. we need to mention that value instead of step.
student--> so, for example I want numbers from 0 to 20 with a gap of 2, how do I do it??
teacher--> like this 
teacher--> for num in range (0,21,2):
teacher--> .     print(num)
teacher--> output: 0
teacher--> 2.....20
teacher--> Here, the values have been incremented by 2 if you see.
student--> woooww, that is co cool, but I have one more question.
teacher--> spit it out!!
student--> what if I want the decreasing sequence?
student--> for example: I want to print all numbers from 10 to 1.
teacher--> glad you asked this question.
student--> ummm...
teacher--> so, for decreasing series, we mention negative numbers in the step.
teacher--> we start from the higher number and end at the lower number.
student--> okayyyy
teacher--> I will show..
teacher--> for num in range (10,1,-1):
teacher--> .   print(num)
teacher--> output: 10,9,8.....2
student--> OHHHH!! But I wanted till 1. the result shows up till 2.
teacher--> yaya!! You noticed it!! Good.
teacher--> Do you remember in the case of positive sequence if we want to stop at num we used to insert num+1 in the end parameter??
student--> Yes, I do!! what about that??
teacher--> So, in case of negative sequence we will insert num-1 in the end parameter to stop at num.
student--> okayyy, this time let me try to make the changes.
student--> for num in range (10,0,-1):
student--> .   print(num)
student--> output: 10,9,8....1
teacher--> perfect!!
student--> Great what is next??
teacher--> We have a lot more in the for loop, but we will continue next time Byeee.
student--> Byeee seee yaaaa!!
