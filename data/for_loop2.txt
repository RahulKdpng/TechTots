teacher--> Hey man! What's up?
student--> Is it a good time to ask what you were mentioning about the for a loop last time?
teacher--> Well, it depends on why you want to know?
student--> So, I came across this quiz on the internet containing a few questions.
teacher--> And you want me to answer them for you?
student--> Shut up and listen first
teacher--> Fine, listening.
student--> I think I need to know more about loops to solve them.
teacher--> Okay, so it is a good time!
teacher--> Let's start with the first question.
student--> It says using "Strings with loops and range"
teacher--> Oh-kay! That's a good one.
teacher--> So, as you might remember string's index starts from O and the last index is len(string)-1
teacher--> So, when you move from letter to letter in a string you move from index 0 to 1 to 2 and so on.
teacher--> Do you think you can relate this with range() in for loop?
student--> Um.... kinda Please guide me sensei
teacher--> Okay! So, the range starts from index=0 and goes till index=len(string)-1 in order to print all the letters in the string.
student--> So for index in range(0, len(string)): This is the format
teacher--> Yep! Let's try this out.
teacher--> word = "bumfuzzle"
teacher--> for index in range(0, len(word)): 
teacher--> .    print(word[index])
student--> We will take an index from the range and keep printing the letter of the word at that index.
student--> Okay This makes sense now.
teacher--> But you know I have an easier way to print letters in the word.
student--> This is exactly what the second question has asked as well.
student--> To exclude the range function and print it exactly this way
teacher--> Seems like I can see the future!
student--> Yeah right! in your dreams!
teacher--> Anyway, so instead of using range(), we mention the string and print it.
teacher--> word = "Bumfuzzle" 
teacher--> for letter in word:
teacher--> .    print(letter)
student--> umm..but...I don't get it.
teacher--> Line 2 says, for letter in variable "word"
teacher--> and our variable word has the string "bumfuzzle"
teacher--> So, we take each letter from this word and print it. Simple.
student--> You just made it easier! Now I get it!
student--> I was wondering if we can make the for-loop work over a slice of a string?
teacher--> Of course, we can.
teacher--> I can guess it's the 3rd question in the quiz, right?
student--> My my! You can guess as well.
teacher--> Do you want your question solved or not?
student--> Oops. I do. Please continue
teacher--> Okay, so as you know we can slice our strings.
student--> In the question, they asked to find a particular letter in the second half of the word.
teacher--> So, in that case, first let us store our word in a variable:
teacher--> word "bumfuzzle"
student--> Next, we need to loop through the second half of the word
teacher--> So we need to start slicing the word from half-length of the word.
teacher--> word = "bumfuzzle" 
teacher--> length = len(word)/2
teacher--> half_word = word[length:]
student--> How do we search the word in this now?
teacher--> We'll need the conditions here
teacher--> word "bumfuzzle"
teacher--> length = len(word)/2
teacher--> half_word =word[Length:]
teacher--> for i in half_word:
teacher--> .    if i=="z":
teacher--> .           print("found")
teacher--> Using the if we're checking if the current letter stored in i is equal to the letter we want to find.
student--> Got it!
student--> We have one last question left
student--> And here they have asked to print the letters in reverse.
teacher--> Easy peasy! We are gonna use all the things we have learned till now to solve the 4th question.
teacher--> To print the reversed version of your string we will need to slice the string and for loop.
student--> slicing, dicing, and reversing with a hint of the loop!! Sounds fun
teacher--> So let's begin!
teacher--> To reverse the string we need to use
student--> It seems like -1 will be doing all the work in reversing the string.
teacher--> So, now if we use the for loop over this.
student--> It's going to print each letter in the reversed string.
student--> I think I know how to write the code for this.
student--> word = "bumfuzzle" 
student--> for i in word[::-1]: 
student--> .     print(i)
teacher--> Seems like you were able to write it.
teacher--> Let' see if it runs.
teacher--> word = "bumfuzzle" 
teacher--> for i in word[::-1]: 
teacher--> .    print(i)
teacher--> My my! It runs as well.
student--> Don't underestimate me
teacher--> I'm scared now!
teacher--> But as of now, we are done with everything about for loops.
student--> Thanks to you I was finally able to solve the quiz! And I got full marks as well.
teacher--> You got half the marks because I did half of the work.
