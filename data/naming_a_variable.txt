teacher--> Hey man! i need your help!
student-->My Help!
student--> is this for real or am i dreaming?
teacher-->oh, come on! it is not the time to be cracking jokes.
teacher--> I am really stuck with this one!
student-->okay then, what got you so tensed?
teacher-->I need a porper variable name!
student-->well that's simple. just name it x, and be done with it!
teacher--> How is x a proper name?
teacher--> Besides, i'm not gonna make that mistake again!
student--> why, what's wrong with it?
teacher-->Everything! the last time i used names like x. I couldn't undertstand my program.
student--> so basically, you want names that make sense.
teacher-->exactly!
student-->well, what do you wanna store in the variable?
teacher-->a player's name.
student-->It can't be easier, dude! Just use player name.
teacher-->we can't have spaces in a variable name, did you forget that?
student-->oh, my god. then, let's put a symbol in between like player-name.
teacher--> are you sure?
student-->what happened again now?
teacher-->the dash(-) we can't use it in a name!
student-->o right! i remember now 
student--> No symbol except underscore(_) in a variable name.
teacher--> and i have already used player_name in the program once.
student--> ideal python is a case-sensitive!!
student--> and it treats small letters and capital letters differently. so you can go with Player_name.
teacher--> i can, but that will be super confusing.
student-->hmmm, you are right! know what, we can use numbers in variable names.
student-->so, player_name_2 will be perfect.
teacher-->yeah, i was also thinking of something similar like playerName2.
student-->i know this one! the n of Name is in capital letter. It's camelcase for sure!
teacher--> That's right! in camel case, we start every new word in the name with a capital letter.
student-->yup, like N in playerName or N and O in playerNameOne.
teacher--> Thank God, that you did not forget about camel case too.
student-->Hey, the space and the dash(-) thing just slipped my mind, I remeber the rest.
teacher-->then tell me, is the name 1ndPlayerName correct?
student-->Of course not! A varibale name can not start with a number.
teacher--> okay i agree, you have not forgotten everything.
student--> Told ya!!
student--> besides this, i also know a way of making your life easier.
teacher-->and what's that?
teacher-->comments, man! just write what a variable stores above its name.
coding--> #stores the second player's name
coding--> playerName2="theo"
student--> that's a brilliant idea!!
teacher-->but remember to start your comments with the hash symbol(#).
student-->will do thanks, buddy!
teacher--> Now, Its Quiz time, So here goes your first question.
teacher--> two variables names start with a #. so python will not read them as it ignores the words after # in a line.
teacher-->   option 1: True
teacher-->   option 2: False
student--> and the correct answer is True, and the reason is that it will consider it as a comment.
teacher--> time for next one, Emily put an & sign in a variable name, and now python is revolting! pick the right symbol for Emily to use.
teacher-->  option 1: dollar ($)
teacher-->	option 2: underscore (_)
teacher-->	option 3: dash (-)
teacher-->	option 4: plus (+)
student--> Answer will be option 2: underscore (_)
teacher--> and here goes last one, Emily left a space in the variable name, suspect name. Drag and drop the right camelcase name for this variable into the blank.
teacher-->	option 1: suspectname
teacher-->	option 2: suspect_name
teacher-->	option 3: suspectName
student--> and correct answer to your last question is option 2: suspect_name
teacher--> excellent work child!!
students--> Thnaks will meet again with new chapter.
