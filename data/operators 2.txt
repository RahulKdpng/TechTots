student--> Hey there!
teacher--> Hi, man! what's up?
student--> well, i have been reading more about Math in python.
teacher-->That's nice
student--> Thanks, and by the way, i found a few questions that will trick you for sure.
teacher-->oh!! really? well, all the best with that then!!
student-->same to you, buddy!! and trust me, you are gonna need it.
student--> so what is 5//2?
teacher--> I know this one it's floor division.
student--> you are off to a good start.
teacher-->so to find the answer, i first calculate 5/2.
student--> well that is 2.5
teacher--> yeah, and now I remove what is after the decimal point.
teacher--> so 2.5 becomes 2!!
student--> damn, you got it right!!
teacher-->told ya,
teacher-->O, and the score is 1.0
student-->Don't get too excited. the next one will be your nightmare.
teacher-->what are you waiting for then? just shoot it!!
student-->then, answer this 
teacher--> print(2 ** 1 ** 3)
teacher--> oh, it will be 2!!
student--> hmmm, good guess!!
teacher--> it is not a guess, I knew it!!
student--> so you can explain how you got then??
teacher--> of course! when it comes to exponent, we move from right to left while solving them.
teacher--> so here, we solve 1 ** 3 first.
student--> hey, you did not tell me that when we talked about BEMDAS the last time!!
teacher--> that is cuzz you didn't ask.
student--> and I kept solving it from left to right like other math symbols.
teacher--> that must have been a pain.
teacher--> and by the way, it's 2-0 now.
student-->O, I will get past 0 with this one.
student--> print(6%7)
teacher--> Don't think so, cuz I know it's modulus!!
student--> Damn it!! Don't tell me you know every Math symbol in python.
teacher--> Not all, but I know plenty.
teacher--> anyway, modulus is just a fancy name for remainder.
student--> right, it gives us the reminder of a division.
student--> but, what i wanna know is your answer 
teacher--> well. 7 can't divide 6. so, the remainder is 6. 
teacher--> and that's my answer!!
student-->ohh, now it ended as 3-0.
teacher--> that's what happens when you challenge the master!!
teacher--> But please, keep trying!!
student--> Sure will do.
teacher--> Now that you are done with your game now time for me to ask you quiz.
student--> ohhhh, yes its now our quiz time, I am ready for it
teacher--> okay, so the enemy soldiers have built their first battle tactic. fill in the blank with their final strength.
           strength= 3 ** 2 ** 1 
		   print(strength)
student--> so i need to tell the output, and its 3∗∗2∗∗1 is evaluated using the right-to-left order for exponentiation. 
           This means it is equivalent to 3∗∗(2∗∗1), 3∗∗2∗∗1 evaluates to 9. 
teacher--> good going, next one , an enemy dragon of strength 100 is attacking arithmetica. their commanders with strength 11 and 12  dive into the battle. will they reduce the dragon's strength to 0?
		   dragnStrength = 100 * (11 // 12)
		   option1: yes, option2: No 
student--> so here is my answer, The expression 100∗(11//12) evaluates to 0, which means the dragon's strength is reduced to 0.
		   So, the correct option is: Option 1: Yes
teacher--> Research in arithmetica yeilds a new weapon, the floor division //. using it, they built a tactic to reduce the enemy's strength. Fill in the blank with the result.
		   enemy_strength= 8 ** 2 // 12
		   print(enemy_strength)
student--> To find the result of the expression 8∗∗2//12:
		   First, we evaluate the exponentiation: 8∗∗2=64
		   Next, we perform floor division by 12:64//12=5
		   So, the result is 5.
teacher--> well done kid, now let's go deep into coding practice, follow me!!
