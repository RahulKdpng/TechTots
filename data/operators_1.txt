student-->Hey man, I think there is something wrong with python.
teacher-->Trust me bro, whatever it is. Python is right.
techer--> You must be missing something.
student--> Then what is 3+5*2?
teacher--> 13
student--> What, how? It must be 16?
student--> Like, 3+5 will give us 8, and then we multiply 8 by 2 to get 16.
teacher--> Okay, I see what is the problem here. You don't know about BEMDAS.
student--> What the fish is that?
teacher--> Stop freaking out, man. Let's just look at what BEMDAS stands for.
           B - BRACKETS
		   E - EXPONENT
		   M - MULTIPLICATION
		   D - DIVISION
		   A - ADDITION
		   S - SUBSTRACTION
student--> But how is this gonna solve my problem?
teacher--> Well, this is more like a rule for python.
teacher--> So while doing Math, python solves the symbols in this order.
student--> Oh! But bro, i will need more than that.
teacher--> Okay, Let's take an example.
           9 + 7 * (8 - 4) / 2 - 3 ** 2
student--> That looks scary!!
teacher--> Don't worry. we will go step by step.
teacher--> So, Python first solves the Brackets.
student--> You mean (8 - 4)?
teacher--> Yup!!
teacher--> 9 + 7 * (8 - 4) / 2 - 3 ** 2
           9 + 7 * 4 / 2 - 3 ** 2
teacher--> Then it goes for the EXPONENT.
student--> What is that??
teacher--> It is Python's way pf calling power. The symbol is **.
student--> got it!! so we solve 3 ** 2 next, and that is 9.
teacher--> 9 + 7 * (8 - 4) / 2 - 3 ** 2
           9 + 7 * 4 / 2 - 3 ** 2
		   9 + 7 * 4 / 2 - 9
teacher--> Next, Python either multiplies or divides.
teacher--> And it depends on what comes first while moving from left to right.
student--> So, in 9 + 7 * 4 / 2 - 9, multiplication comes first.
teacher--> Yup, and that is why python multiplies next.
           9 + 7 * (8 - 4) / 2 - 3 ** 2
           9 + 7 * 4 / 2 - 3 ** 2
		   9 + 7 * 4 / 2 - 9
		   9 + 28 / 2 - 9
student--> Now, it is division time!!
teacher--> 9 + 7 * (8 - 4) / 2 - 3 ** 2
           9 + 7 * 4 / 2 - 3 ** 2
		   9 + 7 * 4 / 2 - 9
		   9 + 28 / 2 - 9
           9 + 14 - 9		   
teacher--> Next, Python either adds or substracts.
student--> let me guess, it depends on what comes first while moving from left to right.
teacher--> Correct And here + comes first.
student--> So, we add??
teacher--> 9 + 7 * (8 - 4) / 2 - 3 ** 2
           9 + 7 * 4 / 2 - 3 ** 2
		   9 + 7 * 4 / 2 - 9
		   9 + 28 / 2 - 9
           9 + 14 - 9	
		   23 - 9
teacher--> Finally pythin substracts,
           9 + 7 * (8 - 4) / 2 - 3 ** 2
           9 + 7 * 4 / 2 - 3 ** 2
		   9 + 7 * 4 / 2 - 9
		   9 + 28 / 2 - 9
           9 + 14 - 9	
		   23 - 9
		   14
teacher--> So, here is how it all went.
student--> You know what, it all makes sense now.
student--> In my case of 3 + 5 * 2 Python first multiplies and then adds. That's why the result was 13.
teacher--> Yup, and if you want python to add first, just put brackets around 3 and 5.
           (3 + 5) * 2
student--> Got it, Thanks man!!!!!
teacher--> now again here comes our quiz time, ready for it!!
student--> I am born ready for it go ahead with your questions.
teacher--> so today I have 3 questions for you to solve
student--> okay, lets do it!!
teacher--> An arithmetica soldier uses the magical symbols to reduce an enemy's strength to 6. use the correct + and - symbols in the right gaps to see .
           strength= 15 (blank) 3 - 5 (blank) 7
student--> So, the equation should be: 15+3âˆ’5âˆ’7
teacher--> well done!! time for next one
teacher--> commander uses * and / on the enemies. their final strength is less than 5.
           enemy_strength=34/17*3/6
		   option1: yes
		   option2: No
student--> The correct answer is option1: yes
teacher--> here come another one, a legendary arthmetica sorcerer uses the symbol % to attck! rearrange the below lines to show ho he reduces the emeny's strength to 0.
           34/17*3%6
		   give step wise evaluation
student--> 34/17*3%6
           2*3%6
		   6%6
		   0
teacher--> well done, now lets try some lab and try to solve some of the basics easy question.
student--> sure, thanks..
