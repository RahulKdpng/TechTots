student--> Hey, man! you there?
teacher-->Hi, buddy
student-->Hey I want to know everything about loops today!
teacher--> I can tell you everything. But the question is, can you take it all at once?
student--> That vast huh?
teacher--> hmmm-mmm, so let's see how to write loops in Python first.
student--> Man, I am not even surprised anymore!!
teacher--> Get used to it! Anyway, let us start with the first one, while loop!!
student--> Okay then, let us start now!!
teacher--> well, remember my hacking prank??
student-->yeah, I remember it very well!!
student--> percentage=0
student--> repeat till percentage <= 100:
student-->     print ("hacking 10:45:65: 78:98", percentage, "%")
student-->	   percentage = percentage + 20
student--> print ("System hacked, and you are under the watch of the Red Eye Now!")
teacher-->okayed let me make the changes.
teacher--> percentage=0
teacher--> while percentage <= 100:
teacher-->     print ("hacking 10:45:65: 78:98", percentage, "%")
teacher-->   percentage = percentage + 20
teacher--> print ("System hacked, and you are under the watch of the Red Eye Now!")
teacher--> and we are done now!!
student-->seriously!!
teacher--> yup! cuz whenever Python finds a while in the program it knows there is a loop.
student--> what is while loop then??
teacher--> while is used to repeatedly execute instructions as long as condition is true.
student-->hmm, okay!! so here, python starts with making the variable percentage.
student-->	percentage=0 # initialisation of a variable 
teacher-->so in this, we will replace repeat till with the word while.
student--> hmm-mm listening!!
teacher--> Then in line 2, it checks the condition inside while.
teacher-->percentage=0
teacher-->  while percentage <= 100: #condition 
student--> And that is True cuz, the value of percentage is 0, which is less than 100, so python starts the loop!!
teacher--> Right, and inside it, python displays the message.
teacher-->	percentage=0
teacher--> repeat till percentage <= 100:
teacher-->      print ("hacking 10:45:65: 78:98", percentage, "%”) #displays the message.
teacher--> Next, it increases the percentage by 20.
teacher-->percentage=0
teacher--> while percentage <= 100:
teacher-->     print ("hacking 10:45:65: 78:98", percentage, "%")
teacher-->	   percentage = percentage + 20 #increment of the variable 
student--> Now, Python goes back to the first line, of the loop.
teacher--> And there, it checks the condition again!!
student--> Which is True again, as 20 is less than 100.
teacher--> percentage=0
teacher--> while percentage <= 100: #percentage becomes 20 so we get the condition True.
teacher-->     print ("hacking 10:45:65: 78:98", percentage, "%")
teacher-->	   percentage = percentage + 20 
teacher--> Yup!! so python goes inside the loop again.
student--> And this keeps on happen until the percentage is less than or equal to 100.
teacher--> hmm-mm, but when the value gets to 120, the condition becomes False.
student--> Right!!
teacher-->That's why Python skips the loop and moves to the instruction below it.
student--> Cool!! so I guess that's it for the while loop!!
teacher--> just one thing, let us remove the last two lines from the code.
student--> you mean percentage = percentage +20
teacher--> want to guess what will happen now?
student--> well, python will start the loop as percentage <= 100 is True at first.
teacher--> yup, no Suprise there.
student--> Right, then inside the loop, it will display the hacking message.
teacher--> True, go ahead!!
student--> wait a sec!! you are not increasing the value of percentage anywhere!!
teacher--> Exactly, so percentage <= 100 is going to be True always, as percentage is 0 every time.
student--> Meaning, I will be an infinite loop.
teacher--> Bingo, so it is very important to increase the value of percentage and now we are done with this!!
student--> Then I got to go.
teacher--> Where are you running off too dude??
student--> what do you mean, chapter over right??
teacher--> No child, it’s now coding time!!
student--> okay let’s begin, got to go soon to prank my friends also with this cool feature now 
teacher--> okay
